\abstractEn{In recent years machine learning has had significant breakthroughs in many fields mainly through the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Their name derives from the vague relation shared between their basic elements, 
namely neurons, to the biological neurons that constitute animal brains. After decades of obscurity due to inadequate results they have recently returned to the forefront of scientific machine learning experimentation.
The main reason being the work of \cite{aa} which showed substantially improved results over the state of the art, at the time, in image object classification. Following that breakthrough, a trend of using neural networks began 
to emerge which gave birth to the the area of Deep Learning. Informally, that area constitutes the usage of increasingly deeper and more complex network architectures in order to solve more complicated problems while 
exploiting the abundance of data that the current technological age offers. The subject of this master thesis is to use a special case of ANN called Convolutional Neural Networks, in the context of multitask learning 
from spectogram images originating from music data.}
\abstractGr{Τα τελευταία χρόνια ο κλάδος της μηχανικής μάθησης έχει καταφέρει σημαντική πρόοδο σε πολλές ερευνητικές περιοχές χρησιμοποιώντας Τεχνητά Νευρωνικά Δίκτυα (ΤΝΝ). Το όνομα τους προέρχεται από την αμυδρή σχέση μεταξύ
των βασικών τους στοιχείων, τους νευρώνες, με τους βιολογικούς νευρώνες που απαρτίζουν τους εγκεφάλους των ζώων. Έπειτα απο δεκαετίες στην αφάνεια λόγω χαμηλής απόδοσης, επέστρεψαν πρόσφατα στο επίκεντρο της επιστημονικής έρευνας.
Ο κύριος λόγος ήταν η δημοσίευση των \cite{aa} που εμφάνισε σημαντικά βελτιωμένα αποτελέσματα σε σχέση με το state of the art, της περιόδου, στην ταξινόμηση αντικειμένων σε εικόνες. Ακολουθώντας αυτή την πρωτοπορία, μια τάση
της χρήσης νευωρνικών δικτύων άρχισε να εμφανίζεται που με την σειρά της γέννησε τον κλάδο του Deep Learning. Η περιοχή αυτή αφορά την χρήση βαθύτερων και πολυπλοκότερων αρχιτεκτονικών δικτύων για την επίλυση πιο δύσκολων 
προβλημάτων εκμεταλλευόμενος την πληθώρα δεδομένων που η τρέχουσα τεχνολογική περίοδος προσφέρει. Το θέμα της μεταπτυχιακής διπλωματικής είναι η χρήση μια ειδικής περίπτωσης ΤΝΝ λεγόμενα Νευρωνικά Δίκτυα Συνέλιξης, στο πλαίσιο
της μάθησης πολλαπλών στόχων από εικόνες φασματογραφημάτων που προέρχονται από δεδομένα μουσικής.}
